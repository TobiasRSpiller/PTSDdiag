# Determine PTSD diagnosis based on DSM-5 criteria using binarized scores

Determines whether DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD are met using
binarized symptom scores (0/1) for PCL-5 items. This is an alternative
to determine_ptsd_diagnosis() that works with pre-binarized data.

## Usage

``` r
create_ptsd_diagnosis_binarized(data)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A dataframe containing exactly 20 columns of PCL-5 item scores (output
  of rename_ptsd_columns) named symptom_1 to symptom_20. Each symptom
  should be scored on a 0-4 scale where:

  - 0 = Not at all

  - 1 = A little bit

  - 2 = Moderately

  - 3 = Quite a bit

  - 4 = Extremely

  Note: This function should only be used with raw symptom scores
  (output of rename_ptsd_columns) and not with data containing a total
  score column, as the internal binarization process would invalidate
  the total score.

## Value

A dataframe with a single column "PTSD_orig" containing TRUE/FALSE
values indicating whether DSM-5 diagnostic criteria are met based on
binarized scores

## Details

The function applies the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD using binary
indicators of symptom presence:

- Criterion B (Intrusion): At least 1 present symptom from items 1-5

- Criterion C (Avoidance): At least 1 present symptom from items 6-7

- Criterion D (Negative alterations in cognitions and mood): At least 2
  present symptoms from items 8-14

- Criterion E (Alterations in arousal and reactivity): At least 2
  present symptoms from items 15-20

## Examples

``` r
# Create sample data
sample_data <- data.frame(
  matrix(sample(0:4, 20 * 10, replace = TRUE),
         nrow = 10,
         ncol = 20)
)
colnames(sample_data) <- paste0("symptom_", 1:20)

# Get diagnosis using binarized approach
diagnosis_results <- create_ptsd_diagnosis_binarized(sample_data)
diagnosis_results$PTSD_orig
#>  [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
```
